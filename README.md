The osTicket life cycle refers to the entire journey a support ticket goes through —
from the moment it is created by a user, to the point it is resolved and closed by an agent.
  1. Ticket Creation (Submission Stage)

Who: The User (Customer)
How:
		A user submits a request via the web form, email, or API.
		osTicket automatically creates a new Ticket ID.

What Happens:
		The system captures user details, subject, message, and attachments.
		A confirmation email (auto-responder) is sent to the user.

 Purpose: Starts the life cycle — a problem officially enters your support system.

⸻

2. Ticket Assignment / Routing

Who: System or Admin
How:
		Based on the Help Topic or Email Address, osTicket automatically assigns the ticket to the appropriate Department.
		Within that department, it may be automatically or manually assigned to a specific Agent or Team.

What Happens:
		SLA (Service Level Agreement) timers begin tracking response deadlines.
		Alerts are sent to the assigned department or team.

 Purpose: Ensures the ticket reaches the right people as quickly as possible.

⸻

3. Ticket Response (Agent Engagement Stage)

Who: Agent (Staff Member)
How:
		The assigned agent views the ticket, investigates the issue, and responds to the user.
		Communication happens directly in the ticket thread.

What Happens:
		Every reply or internal note is logged in the ticket history.
		The user receives responses via email or the client portal.
		Status changes (e.g., from Open → Answered).

 Purpose: Begins the problem-solving process and maintains communication transparency.

⸻

4. Ticket Collaboration / Escalation

Who: Agent, Supervisor, or Team
How:
		If the ticket requires input from another department, it’s transferred or assigned to a team.
		Escalation can occur if the issue isn’t resolved within SLA time limits.

What Happens:
	  The ticket may move between departments.
		Supervisors are notified of overdue or escalated tickets.

 Purpose: Ensures complex or time-sensitive issues get the right attention.

⸻

5. Ticket Resolution

Who: Assigned Agent or Team
How:
		The agent finds a solution, replies to the user with final details, and marks the ticket as Resolved or Closed.

What Happens:
		The user is notified of resolution.
		The system records the resolution time for reporting.

 Purpose: Closes the support loop and provides user satisfaction.

⸻

6. Ticket Closure (Completion Stage)

Who: System or Admin
How:
		A resolved ticket can automatically close after a set time, or the agent can close it manually.

What Happens:
		The ticket becomes read-only (archived).
		The user may receive a “Ticket Closed” email confirmation.

� Purpose: Finalizes the support interaction and keeps the queue clean.

⸻

7. Post-Closure Review / Reporting

Who: Admin or Manager
How:
		Review metrics under Dashboard → Reports for ticket volume, SLA compliance, and agent performance.
		Optionally, send follow-up surveys for feedback.

 Purpose: Helps improve service quality and agent efficiency over time.
 
 In Summary:

The osTicket Life Cycle is the heartbeat of your helpdesk —
it transforms customer problems into structured workflows, ensures timely responses, and maintains complete visibility from submission → solution → closure.
